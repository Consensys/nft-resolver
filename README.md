# NFT Resolver

The NFT Resolver is intented to be used to resolve any subdomain for a specific ENS domain where a NFT collection has been deployed on Linea.  
More precisely it is ID based, meaning the resolution of an address for a subdomain is determined by the ownership of the NFT's ID on the target NFT contract on Linea.
